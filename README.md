# The Wizarding Programming Language

This is the home of what I would humbly call, literally the best programming language to exist. Now why is it great? Let me explain with a snippet

```wizarding
ðŸœ™incðŸœ„xðŸœ‚x+1;incðŸœ„xðŸœ‚;
```

So, yeah you probably get the jist. It's just a kaleidoscope-esque (for now)
programming language that uses alchemical symbols in places for no reason.
