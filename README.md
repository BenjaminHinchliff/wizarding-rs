# The Wizarding Programming Language

> :warning: this is still in its really early stages right now so is basically

This is the home of what I would humbly call, literally the best programming language to exist. Now why is it great? Let me explain with a snippet

```wizarding
🜹sin🜄x🜂;🜙thing🜄x🜂sin🜄x🜂*x;thing🜄2.0🜂;
```

So, yeah you probably get the jist. It's just a kaleidoscope-esque (for now)
programming language that uses alchemical symbols in places for no reason.
